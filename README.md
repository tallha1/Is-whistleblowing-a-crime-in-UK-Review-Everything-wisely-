<br>

With the advent on institutions and enterprises, the business and legal processes have picked speed. Amidst all that, there are heinous acts being committed right under the noses of the stakeholders, who then turn a blind eye; too distracted by the lucrative outcomes.
We got in touch with <a href="https://iamsamirahman.com/" style="text-color:black">Barrister Sami Rahman</a>, a young, neat solicitor making his mark in the employment tribunals inside the UK, about his experience with the <a href="https://iamsamirahman.com/" style="text-color:black">whistleblowers</a>. Sami is a well experienced lawyer who has defended his clients successfully against the repercussions that come with <a href="https://iamsamirahman.com/" style="text-color:black">whistleblowing</a> inside their organizations.
One of the case summary and judgement of the tribunal that he took on is published here:

“We are humans and we are directed by our passion, the drive to do right by ourselves and the people around us. The society and organizations though, have created an environment where it gets extremely difficult to point out a system of injustice and malice.
 There are so many people benefitting from one irregularity that it almost feels as if you have to wage a war against the whole organization if you are every awakened by your conscience,” he said. 
This letter of concern is directed towards the common public and the lawmakers to take a notice and introduce laws that protect <a href="https://iamsamirahman.com/" style="text-color:black">whistleblowers</a>, at least as long as their claims are scrutinized. It will be a tedious process but the society and growing economics direly need a check and balance system, from their own teams only.
